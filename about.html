      <p>My name is Jun Park, a licensed HVAC technician based in Ontario. I specialize in both commercial and residential HVAC systems. I currently work with commercial equipment such as rooftop units and make-up air systems, and am fully capable of troubleshooting, servicing, repairing, installing, and maintaining these systems.</p>
      <p>I also provide residential HVAC services including furnace and AC installations, as well as condenser setups. I hold a G2 gas license and have certification to handle refrigerants. In addition, Iâ€™m trained to operate various equipment including scissor lifts and Genie lifts safely and effectively.</p>
      <p>My goal is to deliver reliable and efficient service to ensure your systems are running at peak performance year-round.</p>
